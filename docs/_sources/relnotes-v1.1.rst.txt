UnetStack and simulator v1.1 release notes
==========================================

September 1, 2013

New features
------------

* Added ``version`` property on each agent, and a ``ver`` shell command
* GUI shell support (as default when running ``unetsh``)
* Support for data plotting in GUI
* Remote ``ps`` now possible (``rps``) when operating with ``unetsh``
* ``DATAGRAM`` service defined, including:
    * Merging of ``LinkParam.MTU`` and ``PhysicalChannelParam.MTU`` into ``DatagramParam.MTU``
    * Renaming of ``LinkCapability`` to ``DatagramCapability``
* Added datagram delivery/failure notifications
* ``AbnormalTerminationManager`` and ``AbnormalTerminationNtf`` added to manage misbehaving agents
* Remote agent updated to support command execution, text messages, file transfers, and for improved syntax for remote node proxies
* Automatic registration of agent parameters for remote access
* Reliable acoustic link (``ReliableLink``) agent implemented
* Implemented ``UdpLink`` agent reliability
* Multi-link routing (``Router``) agent implemented along with route management commands in shell
* Stop-and-wait batch transport (``SWTransport``) agent implemented
* Added support for changing frame length and link rate for individual simulation nodes using ``HalfDuplexModem``

Changes
-------

* Subscriptions in shell disabled by default for most agents
* Solicited notifications are now sent to requesting agent, rather than broadcasted on a topic
* Moved to use Groovy 2.1.6
* Moved to fjåge 1.3.1 from 1.2:
    * Fjåge release notes: `[v1.3.1] <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fjage-users/2M_FtV2zzRY>`_ `[v1.3] <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fjage-users/dibfe8w2Ijk>`_ `[v1.2.2] <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fjage-users/tw5Zf-7hil4>`_
    * Changes to take specific note of:
        * "include" command replaced with "shellImport"
        * "delay()" should be used in preference to "sleep()"
* Changed fjåge prompt from ``$`` to ``>``
* Simulation DSL now supports multiple shells per node
* Clean up of messages and field names, including:
    * Remote parameter messages use ``remoteAgentID`` instead of ``paramAid``
    * ``requestID`` removed from MAC messages, use ``inReplyTo`` instead
    * Added channel type and bad data to ``BadFrameNtf``
    * Removed script name from ``RemoteScriptNtf``
    * Removed processing time from ``TxFrameNtf`` and ``RxFrameNtf``
    * Fixed spelling error in many messages: ``recepient`` changed to ``recipient``
    * ``peer`` renamed to ``from`` or ``to`` in ranging messages
* Renamed ``RemoteAgent`` to ``RemoteControl``
* Renamed ``AlohaCS`` to ``AlohaACS``, and implemented adaptive carrier sensing functionality
* Renamed few parameters and added new parameters:
    * Renamed and moved ``HalfDulplexModem.linkRate`` to ``PhysicalChannelParam.dataRate``
    * Renamed ``PhysicalChannelParam.maxFrameDuration`` to ``PhysicalChannelParam.frameDuration``
    * Added several new ``PhysicalChannelParam`` (``frameLength``, ``maxFrameLength``, ``fec``, ``fecList``)
    * Renamed ``remote.link`` to ``remote.transport``
* Allow zero-byte datagrams to be transmitted by all agents
* ``UdpLink`` now avoids transmitting to itself (broadcast, or specific unicast to self)
* 3-node-network and mission2012 simulations now provide a console shell
* Several documentation updates

Bugfixes
--------

* Fix for possible hash clash for remote access
* Fix to provide MAC response without waiting for PHY availability
* Several other minor fixes
