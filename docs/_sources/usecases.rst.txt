Use cases
=========

UnetStack software
------------------
The following highlight some of the use cases for UnetStack software. Identify your use case and look at the relevant documentation as indicated.


Protocol Reseachers
-------------------

* Developing custom MAC or routing or application protocols
* Once protocols are tested in simulation, sea-trials can be carried out in a compatible modem such as Unet-2.

* Custom Physical layer signalling schemes can be tried out in simulation and then easily tested via Baseband service of any UnetStack Baseband service enabled modem.

Modem makers
------------

Modem manufacturers with proprietary hardware can consider migrating to UnetStack for their software.
UnetStack offers a highly modular and versatile architecture.

* UnetStack has been ported to one version of EvoLogics WiSE modem
* Unet-2 modems implement UnetStack with a proprietary Physical driver agent.
* Users wishing to port UnetStack to any other modem hardware need to implement a Physical driver agent


Modem users
------------

* UnetStack with Unet-2 hardware

Some of the following use cases require UnetStack software used together with Unet-2 modems.

* Modem OEM for AUVs or sensor nodes

Makers of AUVs or underwater sensor nodes can incorporate Unet-2 modem hardware and UnetStack software into their system. 

Multiple possibilities exist

* With no related components 
* With existing transducer and wet-end
* Link modem with a sensor node externally via a cable

Users may also require integration of Unet-2 modems into Surface Buoys or Gateways to talk to assets underwater. 
Such gateways may require access via generic Internet protocols.
