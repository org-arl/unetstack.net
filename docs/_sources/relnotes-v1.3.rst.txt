UnetStack and simulator v1.3 release notes
==========================================

March 26, 2016

New features
------------

* Integrated development environment (IDE), and out-of-the-box support for Windows OS.
* Shebang (``//! Sim``) to mark simulation scripts, deprecating the need to say ``unet sim`` to run a simulation.
* `PDU <cookbook.html#encoding-and-decoding-pdus>`_ utility class introduced to simplify encoding/decoding of PDUs.
* `FSMBuilder <javadoc/org/arl/unet/FSMBuilder.html>`_ utility class introduced to simplify development of FSMs.
* Simulator now fully supports the Baseband service.
* Added shell closures for baseband service access.
* Added baseband utilities for creating and looking for CW pulses.
* Added sample channel model ``samples/mission2013b`` based on Chitre & Chua (2014).
* Added support for time-to-live and priority in ``DatagramReq`` and ``ReservationReq``.
* Improved `MAC service specifications <svc-21-mac.html>`_ to support ``TIMED_RESERVATION`` capability, ``ReservationRsp`` with ``estimatedStartTime`` and new parameters for maximum and recommended reservation size.
* Added `MAC tutorial <mac.html>`_ to documentation.
* Web-based shell access.

Changes
-------

* Improved `documentation <docs.html>`_.
* Switched to JDK 1.8, Groovy 2.4.4 and fjåge 1.4.
* Switched to using JSON/TCP remote access from fjåge 1.4, rather than the old RMI remote access.
* ``unet sh/csh`` now uses port number for connection (instead of container name).
* ``JsonTypeAdapter`` introduced to manage polymorphism of parameters and capabilities in JSON messages.
* Added ``name()`` method to ``NamedParameter`` to follow with ``Enum.name()`` method.
* ``UnetError`` renamed to ``UnetException``, and made to extend RuntimeException rather than an Error, to comply with Java convention.
* Moved ``VarInputPDU`` and ``VarOutputPDU`` to remote package.
* ``load`` closure now supports floating point data.
* ``RemoteFileNtf`` is now sent for ``RemoteFilePutReq``.
* Router MTU a now a settable parameter.
* Changed convention to avoid dummy values (such as -1) for primitives when undefined, in favor of using wrapper types with ``null`` as values with undefined.
* Renamed MAC agent in stack to ``mac`` by default (rather than ``aloha`` or ``maca``).
* Removed ``rps`` command, as fjåge 1.4's ``ps`` command now shows remote agents too.

Bugfixes
--------

* Several minor bug fixes.
* Default data type of ``DatagramReq`` is now ``Physical.DATA``, as it should have been.
* Tracer now only counts DATA packets for throughput estimation.
